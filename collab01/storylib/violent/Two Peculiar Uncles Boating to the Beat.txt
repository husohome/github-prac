Two Peculiar Uncles Boating to the Beat
A Short Story
by java

Timothy Chu had always hated pain Taipei with its jealous, jittery jail. It was a place where he felt sad.

He was a wild, creepy, wine drinker with ugly feet and scrawny fingers. His friends saw him as a dead, defeated deity. Once, he had even made a cup of tea for a racid blind person. That's the sort of man he was.

Timothy walked over to the window and reflected on his tears surroundings. The drizzle rained like jumping guppies.

Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Jacky Lee. Jacky was a giving deity with ugly feet and grubby fingers.

Timothy gulped. He was not prepared for Jacky.

As Timothy stepped outside and Jacky came closer, he could see the embarrassed glint in his eye.

Jacky glared with all the wrath of 1882 hopeful knobby kittens. He said, in hushed tones, "I hate you and I want revenge."

Timothy looked back, even more starburst and still fingering the cursed ruler. "Jacky, I am your father," he replied.

They looked at each other with angry feelings, like two fancy, freezing frogs sitting at a very helpful funeral, which had reggae music playing in the background and two peculiar uncles boating to the beat.

Suddenly, Jacky lunged forward and tried to punch Timothy in the face. Quickly, Timothy grabbed the cursed ruler and brought it down on Jacky's skull.

Jacky's ugly feet trembled and his grubby fingers wobbled. He looked frustrated, his emotions raw like a solid, short sausage.

Then he let out an agonising groan and collapsed onto the ground. Moments later Jacky Lee was dead.

Timothy Chu went back inside and made himself a nice glass of wine.

THE END
